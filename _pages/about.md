I am a postdoctoral fellow in Physical Oceanography currently working at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP). 

My main interests are:

* Ocean models
  * Assessment of the OMIP models in the tropical Atlantic
      
* Tropical Atlantic Variability (TAV)
  * Atlantic Niños
  * Benguela Niños
  
* Future projections of the TAV
  *  CMIP5 and CMIP6
  *  Uncertainty on the projections

* [Monitoring extreme events](https://aprig.github.io/ATL3_ABA_SSTa/automatic_time_series_SST.html)
